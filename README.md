3. Add a file to your fork of the repository on your personal GitHub page
4. Create a pull request to send your file to the original ("upstream") repository: 
  - click the `Pull requests` button under the name of the repository
  - click the green `New pull request` button
  - Make sure your fork is on the right-hand side, and the upstream repo on the left-hand side; the arrow indicates in which direction your changes need to flow. 
  - Click the green `Create pull request` button 
  - Provide a title and description for your pull request and click the button.

NB: the term "fork" does not refer to the eating utensil but to the imagery of a fork in a river, the place where a branch splits off from the main branch of a river:

Most repositories will not be like the Nile but like the Upper Columbia river...
